## UFC-dashboard ðŸ¦µðŸ‘ŠðŸ¦µ

# Exercise

As part of an exercise of the Data Analytics bootcamp, I made a dashboard with the data taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset). 

After cleaning it for taking insights, I created a tool where everyone can compare herself/himself to the UFC champs! Just set your meassures and you can see the different UFC champions with the same meassures and you can discover how many times the fighter fought for the title and where he or she did it.
